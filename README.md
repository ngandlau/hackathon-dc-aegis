## What is AEGIS?

**AEGIS** automatically builds dashboards for any disease using heterogenous data sources, empowering health experts to make fast & data-driven decisions.

We leverage specialized AI agents:

* **Data Engineer Agent**: Deep Research but for datasets
* **Analysis Agent**: Preprocesses & combines data sources
* **Response Agent**: Comes up with actionable items from graphs & data

| Agent | Key Tasks |
|-------|-----------|
| **DataAgent** | Searches for data on official health portals, Twitter/X, Reddit |
| **AnalysisAgent** | Cleans and unifies heterogeneous datasets |
| **ResponseAgent** | Summarizes key trends & anomalies |

Make sure to use Python >3.10.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry shell
poetry install
```

Launch the dashboard:
